# Job Market & Hiring Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes job postings data to understand hiring patterns, job visibility, and candidate attraction. The analysis focuses on job roles, locations, salary ranges, remote work availability, experience levels, and engagement metrics such as views.

## Dataset
The dataset includes job postings with information on:
- Job title categories
- State and country
- Remote work status
- Salary ranges
- Work type and experience level
- Job views

## Objectives
- Identify dominant job categories
- Analyze geographic hiring concentration
- Understand salary distribution
- Examine remote work availability
- Assess engagement using job views

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Job postings are concentrated in IT & Engineering, Sales, Healthcare, and Administrative roles.
- Many postings fall under the “Other” category, indicating diverse job types.
- Hiring is concentrated in major U.S. states such as CA, TX, NY, FL, NC, and IL.
- Remote status is mostly “Unknown” due to missing data; remote roles form a smaller portion.
- Salaries mostly range from 40K–160K, with very few roles above 200K.
- Full-time jobs dominate, with balanced entry- and mid-level roles.
- Most postings have fewer than 50 views, limiting reliability of engagement analysis.

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature grouping and categorization
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Visualization of trends
5. Insight interpretation

## How to Run
1. Open the project in GitHub Codespaces
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells in order

## Conclusion
The project highlights strong role and location concentration in hiring, moderate salary ranges, and limited insight into remote opportunities.
